Scyan Engineering,SCY_engineering,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,org.scy.hullmods.ScyEngineering,"TThe Scyan Engineering College optimizes its designs for hunter-killer purposes.

Specialized flux-grids feature immense capacitor reserves and exceptionally strong active venting, limited by poor passive dissipation.

Custom Magneto-Aerospike engines boast exceptional thrust, high durability, fast repair times, and emergency restart functions, though incompatible with further upgrades.

Stealth plating and ambush protocols allow for a lower maintenance and sensor signature when moving slowly, however visibility notably increases from the massive thrust bloom during active maneuvers.","Faster ships that vent quickly, few weapons and little dissipation.",graphics/SCY/hullmods/SCY_engineering.png

Modular Armor,SCY_armorplating,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,org.scy.hullmods.SCY_modularArmor,"This modular armor is a recent innovation that allows specially fitted ships to drop these extremely massive armored plates when they no longer provide protection.

Modifications to the ship may also affect the modules.
